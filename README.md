Motivation
----------

[Jonathan Blow's Videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888) about the Jai language made me realise that I've been focusing too much on functional languages, so I've decided to learn C.
So far I've only used it for small exercises in school (eg. different ways of handeling many sockets), so keep your expectations low.

My previous experience with 3d graphics is limited to a Java (JavaMonkeyEngine) Minecraft clone and a similar block world rendered using Kotlin and OpenGL/GLFW.
